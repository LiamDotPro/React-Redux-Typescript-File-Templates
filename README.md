# React Redux Typescript File Templates

This is a small project intended for use with new ide's that can make use of templating, foremost this mostly applies to IntellijJ based ide's.

Secondly this will include not only react templates but also redux, the patterns used in the files are currently down to my own disgresion but I'll accept pull requests for major improvements if anyone cares.
